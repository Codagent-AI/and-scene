# presentation-skill Specification

## Purpose
Define the behavior of the presentation skill: how it gathers presentation requirements interactively, bootstraps missing infrastructure (monorepo-aware target resolution and the scene kit), and creates or modifies evolving-scene presentations registered at their own routes — self-verifying build and render before reporting done.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Interactive requirement gathering
The skill SHALL gather presentation details by asking the user clarifying questions one at a time — covering the topic, the visual style, and the content and visual description of each step. The user controls how much to specify; the skill SHALL NOT assume details the user can still provide, but SHALL allow the user to proceed with partial detail and iterate. The skill MAY, at its discretion, draw ASCII mockups to represent key or complex steps when doing so helps confirm the intended visual layout.

#### Scenario: Prompt is missing details
- **WHEN** the skill is invoked with a prompt that omits the topic, visual style, or per-step descriptions
- **THEN** the skill asks for the missing information one question at a time rather than assuming it

#### Scenario: User proceeds with partial detail
- **WHEN** the user chooses to build after providing only some details
- **THEN** the skill generates a presentation from what was captured without blocking on a hard completeness gate

#### Scenario: Prompt already complete
- **WHEN** the prompt already contains the topic, style, and all step details
- **THEN** the skill may proceed to build without further questions

#### Scenario: ASCII mockup for a complex step
- **WHEN** a step's visual layout is key or complex
- **THEN** the skill may present an ASCII mockup of that step to the user to confirm the layout before building, without doing so for every step

### Requirement: Self-bootstrapping scaffold
Before creating or modifying a presentation, the skill SHALL ensure the project provides the infrastructure a generated presentation depends on, SHALL resolve where that infrastructure belongs, and SHALL scaffold whatever is missing — including installing the dependencies the infrastructure requires. The required infrastructure is three contract anchors:

1. **Build setup** — a Vite + React + TypeScript app with a working `npm run build`.
2. **Scene kit** — the reusable, presentation-agnostic engine: the `Step`/`Scene` step contract, the stage/host that mounts the active step and runs entity morphs, the present/browse navigation, and the chrome (captions, table of contents) and fit-scale canvas.
3. **Presentation index** — the registry that maps each presentation to its own route so that multiple presentations coexist.

Detection is contract-level, keyed on the presence of these anchors rather than a byte-identical scaffold, so cosmetic differences (file naming, formatting, extra dependencies) do not trigger re-scaffolding. When scaffolding, the skill SHALL NOT assume the required dependencies are already installed.

The scaffold SHALL be styling-framework-neutral and SHALL ship with zero presentation styling defaults. It SHALL install the runtime and build dependencies needed for React, Vite, TypeScript, Motion, Lucide icons, linting, and render verification, but it SHALL NOT require Tailwind, a Tailwind Vite plugin, a default CSS theme, default colors, default fonts, default card styles, default button styles, or any other styling framework. Styling systems MAY be added by the presentation author or host project after scaffolding.

The skill SHALL resolve scaffold templates relative to the skill file that declares them, so agents do not depend on the user's current working directory when locating `templates/bootstrap/` or presentation templates.

#### Scenario: Empty or fully unscaffolded directory
- **WHEN** the skill runs in an empty directory or a project with none of the three anchors present
- **THEN** it performs a full scaffold (build setup, scene kit, and presentation index) and installs the required dependencies before creating the presentation

#### Scenario: Already scaffolded
- **WHEN** all three anchors are already present
- **THEN** the skill skips scaffolding and proceeds directly to creating or modifying the presentation

#### Scenario: Partial scaffold
- **WHEN** some but not all anchors are present
- **THEN** the skill scaffolds only the missing anchors (and their dependencies) without disturbing the ones already present

#### Scenario: Scaffold does not impose a style system
- **WHEN** the skill scaffolds a presentation app
- **THEN** the generated app can build without Tailwind or another styling framework
- **AND** the scaffold does not define default presentation colors, fonts, spacing scale, card styles, button styles, borders, shadows, or CSS theme tokens

#### Scenario: Templates resolve from skill directory
- **WHEN** the skill copies bootstrap or presentation templates
- **THEN** it resolves those paths relative to the skill's own `SKILL.md` directory

#### Scenario: Monorepo target
- **WHEN** the skill runs inside a monorepo
- **THEN** it scaffolds the presentation app into a `presentations/` directory as its own self-contained app rather than at the repository root

#### Scenario: Standalone project target
- **WHEN** the skill scaffolds in an empty or standalone (non-monorepo) project
- **THEN** it scaffolds the presentation app at the repository root

#### Scenario: Non-empty project missing scaffolding
- **WHEN** the project is non-empty but lacks the scene kit or presentation index
- **THEN** the skill states the target location it will scaffold into and proceeds only after the user confirms

### Requirement: Create a new presentation
The skill SHALL generate a new presentation as a self-contained unit reachable at its own route and registered so that multiple presentations coexist.

#### Scenario: New presentation is self-contained and routed
- **WHEN** a new presentation is created
- **THEN** it is written as its own folder, reachable at its own route, and registered in the presentation index

#### Scenario: Presentation owns its visual style
- **WHEN** the skill creates a presentation with a designed visual look
- **THEN** the styling is added in files owned by that presentation or by the host app rather than in the reusable scene kit
- **AND** plain CSS is the default styling approach unless the host project already uses a styling framework or the user explicitly requests one

#### Scenario: Existing presentations are preserved
- **WHEN** a new presentation is created and other presentations already exist
- **THEN** the existing presentations remain intact and reachable

### Requirement: Modify an existing presentation
The skill SHALL support modifying an existing presentation, identifying the target first and asking only about the requested changes.

#### Scenario: Target unspecified or ambiguous
- **WHEN** the skill is asked to modify a presentation without a clear target
- **THEN** it lists the existing presentations and asks which to modify before changing anything

#### Scenario: Scoped modification
- **WHEN** the target presentation is identified
- **THEN** the skill asks only about the requested changes (steps, entities, or style) and edits that presentation without re-walking the full create flow

### Requirement: Self-verify before reporting completion
Before reporting success, the skill SHALL confirm that the generated or modified presentation builds, renders without errors, and is visually coherent in a browser, fixing any failures itself. The render check SHALL at minimum render the presentation's first step without runtime or console errors; the full multi-step render check across every step is defined by the `presentation-verification` capability. The visual composition check SHALL inspect screenshots or an equivalent browser view of the first step, the last step, and any dense/key steps; responsive-sensitive presentations SHALL also be checked at a narrow viewport. When a project-local screenshot helper is available, the skill SHALL prefer it over ad hoc scripts outside the project tree so browser tooling resolves from local dependencies, settled screenshots are captured after animations complete, and advisory visual warnings can be reviewed.

#### Scenario: Checks run before done
- **WHEN** the skill finishes generating or modifying a presentation
- **THEN** it runs the build, at least a first-step render check, and a browser visual composition check before reporting completion

#### Scenario: Failures are fixed, not reported as success
- **WHEN** the build, render, or visual composition check fails
- **THEN** the skill fixes the issues and re-checks rather than reporting success

### Requirement: Generated presentation quality bar
Every generated presentation SHALL build with no type errors, render its first step without runtime errors, present a caption per step, support next/previous navigation, pass a visual composition check, and conform to the evolving-scene model.

#### Scenario: Builds clean
- **WHEN** a presentation is generated
- **THEN** `npm run build` completes with no type errors

#### Scenario: Renders without errors
- **WHEN** the presentation route is opened
- **THEN** it renders its first step with no runtime or console errors

#### Scenario: Captions and navigation present
- **WHEN** viewing a presentation
- **THEN** each step shows a caption and the user can navigate to the next and previous steps

#### Scenario: Visual composition is inspected
- **WHEN** a presentation is generated or modified
- **THEN** key browser screenshots or equivalent browser views show that important scene content fits the fixed canvas, intentional overlaps remain readable, and content does not collide with chrome such as captions, progress indicators, table of contents, or navigation controls

#### Scenario: Screenshot helper is project-local
- **WHEN** the skill captures screenshots for visual inspection
- **THEN** it uses the scaffolded project-local helper when available, or otherwise writes any temporary Playwright helper under the project root

#### Scenario: Visual warnings are reviewed
- **WHEN** the screenshot helper emits overlap or chrome-polish warnings
- **THEN** the skill reviews the referenced steps, fixes accidental collisions or indistinct current-step chrome, and marks only intentional readable overlaps as allowed

#### Scenario: Active chrome and attribution are styled locally
- **WHEN** the generated presentation includes table-of-contents, progress, navigation, or attribution chrome
- **THEN** presentation-owned or host-owned CSS makes the active step visibly distinct and the attribution legible
- **AND** the reusable scene kit remains free of default colors, fonts, borders, button styles, and theme tokens
