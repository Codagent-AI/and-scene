# presentation-verification Specification

## Purpose
Define how a generated presentation project is automatically verified before the skill reports success: building the whole application and rendering every registered presentation through all of its steps, failing on any build error, console error, or uncaught page error. This guarantees the skill never reports done on output that does not build or render.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Build verification
Verification SHALL build the whole application — all presentations plus the index — and fail if the build does not succeed.

#### Scenario: Build must succeed
- **WHEN** verification runs
- **THEN** it builds the whole app and fails if `npm run build` reports any type or build error

### Requirement: Committed reference sample
A generated sample presentation SHALL be committed in the repository as a known-good fixture, registered and reachable like any other presentation.

The sample is the self-referential talk **"How to Use This Skill to Make a Presentation"** — a presentation, built by the skill, about building presentations with the skill. Its closing beat reveals that the viewer is looking at an example of the skill's own output. The sample SHALL implement the following steps (titles, captions, and scene intent are normative; the per-step visual design is deferred to design):

The sample is one continuously evolving scene: a conversation row (**you** ↔ **skill**) anchors the top, a tray of step cards accumulates below it, and later beats draw frames and connections around what is already on screen. Entities accumulate; they are never rearranged or redrawn.

| # | Era | Title (present) | Caption (browse) | Scene content |
|---|-----|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | the ask | "You have a topic" | It starts with you, a topic, and mild overconfidence. | A **you** entity and a **prompt** bubble appear. |
| 2 | the ask | "The skill interviews you" | One question at a time: the topic, the look, then each beat of the story. | A **skill** node appears; a two-way arrow connects you↔skill with a **question chip** above it. |
| 3 | the gathering | "Answers become steps" | Each answer lands as a step card: a title, a caption, and what the scene should show. | A tray appears under the conversation; the first **step-card** lands in it. |
| 4 | the gathering | "The deck grows" | Same shapes, new beats. Every answer extends the story without redrawing it. | More step-cards land in the tray; everything already on screen stays put. |
| 5 | the gathering | "You set the depth" | Spell out every step, or sketch a few and see how it looks. You hold the gate. | A dashed **ghost card** marks unspecified steps; a partial↔full control docks on **you**. |
| 6 | the build | "It assembles the scene" | Your steps are wired into one evolving scene — one folder, one route, entities that morph. | A route frame draws around the tray in place; the **scene-kit** socket plugs into its edge. |
| 7 | the build | "It checks its own work" | Before saying done, it builds and renders every step — and fixes what breaks. | A **verify** node chains onto the route; build + render checks resolve to a green pass check landing on it. |
| 8 | the loop | "Changed your mind? Loop it." | Point at a step and ask. The skill edits the scene in place — nothing is redrawn from scratch. | A **modify** arc reaches from the conversation down into the route; the edited card is flagged. |
| 9 | the reveal | "You're looking at one" | This presentation was built exactly this way. Thanks for watching. | An outer frame draws around the whole diagram, labeled — self-reference reveal. |

<!-- deferred-to-design: per-step visual design — exact entity shapes, layout coordinates, layoutId namespace, colors, and motion timing — is settled in the design stage. The steps, titles, captions, and scene intent above are fixed. -->

#### Scenario: Sample exists and matches the outline
- **WHEN** verification runs
- **THEN** it confirms the committed reference sample presentation exists, is registered/reachable, and implements the nine steps above in order

#### Scenario: Missing sample fails
- **WHEN** the reference sample is absent
- **THEN** verification fails

### Requirement: Render verification
Verification SHALL render the reference sample through all of its steps and fail if any step produces a runtime or console error. The render check runs the sample in a real browser against a production preview and steps through every step. The preview server and browser navigation SHALL use a deterministic IPv4 loopback address (`127.0.0.1`) so verification does not depend on how `localhost` resolves in the runtime environment. (Mechanism settled in design: `vite preview` + a Playwright/Chromium driver that enumerates steps via the chrome's step-count hook.)

#### Scenario: Every step renders cleanly
- **WHEN** verification renders the sample
- **THEN** it steps through every step and asserts each renders without runtime or console errors

#### Scenario: Preview uses IPv4 loopback
- **WHEN** verification starts the production preview and opens presentation routes
- **THEN** the preview host, readiness probe, and browser URLs use `127.0.0.1` consistently

#### Scenario: Console or page error fails verification
- **WHEN** the sample emits a console error or an uncaught page error while stepping through it
- **THEN** verification fails and identifies the failing step

#### Scenario: Step error fails verification
- **WHEN** any step errors during render
- **THEN** verification fails and identifies the failing step

### Requirement: Pass/fail reporting
Verification SHALL produce an unambiguous pass/fail outcome suitable for automated evals.

#### Scenario: Clear outcome
- **WHEN** verification completes
- **THEN** it reports a clear pass or fail (non-zero exit on failure) identifying which check failed

### Requirement: Visual inspection artifacts
Scaffolded projects SHALL provide a project-local helper that captures per-step screenshots from a production preview for human visual review. The helper SHALL wait for step transition animations to settle before each screenshot and SHALL surface advisory warnings for suspicious text/chrome collisions, visually indistinct active navigation states, and unpolished attribution. The helper supports the skill's visual composition check, but its screenshots and warnings are inspection artifacts rather than automated pass/fail evidence.

#### Scenario: Capture step screenshots
- **WHEN** the screenshot helper runs for a registered presentation
- **THEN** it captures each step at a standard desktop viewport and writes the images under a predictable project-local artifact directory

#### Scenario: Screenshots are settled
- **WHEN** the helper advances from one step to the next
- **THEN** it waits for the configured settle interval before capturing the next screenshot

#### Scenario: Suspicious overlap is reported
- **WHEN** visible text or presentation chrome overlaps another visible text/chrome element without an explicit allow-overlap marker
- **THEN** the helper prints an advisory warning identifying the step and overlapping elements

#### Scenario: Intentional overlap can be marked
- **WHEN** a presentation marks a subtree as allowing overlap
- **THEN** the helper does not report overlap warnings for elements inside that subtree

#### Scenario: Indistinct active chrome is reported
- **WHEN** the active progress indicator or active table-of-contents entry is visually indistinguishable from inactive controls
- **THEN** the helper prints an advisory warning identifying the affected chrome

#### Scenario: Unpolished attribution is reported
- **WHEN** the attribution link appears too small or browser-default
- **THEN** the helper prints an advisory warning pointing authors to the attribution styling hook
